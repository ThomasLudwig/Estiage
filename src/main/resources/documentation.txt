DISTRIBUTION
The program is available upon request to genin@vjf.inserm.fr.
C-language source files will be provided to compile on your computer.
Unzip and Untar the file estiage.tar.gz using either
tar xzvf estiage.tar.gz
or gunzip estiage.tar.gz and tar xvf estiage.tar
Three files will be extracted
1) ageofmut.h : a libray of functions and procedures used by the main program
2) estiage.c : the main program
3) dataAAA.in : an example of input file
Compile the program : cc estiage.c -o estiage -lm

HOW TO RUN THE PROGRAM
Call the program followed by the name of the input file
For instance : ./estiage dataAAA.in
to run the program on the dataset dataAAA.in provided

INPUT DATA FORMAT
The format of the input file is as followed
1st line : should contain 3 integers : the number of patients in the sample,
the number of markers on the left side of the mutation
and the number of markers on the right side of the mutation

2nd line : recombination fractions between the mutation and each marker on the left side (mutation-M1 mutation-M2 ...). If N markers are present on the left, this line should contain N real numbers.

3rd line : frequencies of the shared allele at each marker on the left side.  Note that if a sequential sequencing is performed to detect for each patient the first discordant marker on each side, there should not be any shared allele at the last marker and thus the corresponding frequency may be missing.
Thus if there are N markers, there should be at least N-1 frequencies specified.

4th line : recombination fractions between the mutation and each marker on the right side

5th line : frequencies of the shared allele at each marker of the right side.

6th line : mutation rate at the markers and mutation model (0 : each mutation is equally likely or 1 : stepwise mutation model - see article for more information). This line contains only two values as the same mutation rate and the same mutation model is assumed for all markers.

7th line : shared haplotype on the left side - starting from the mutation, give for each marker the observed allele shared by patients: alleles at the different markers are space-separated. If the shared allele at one marker is unknown: put -1.
For example : 5 1 1 1 2 -1 means that the shared haplotype is known at 5 out of the 6 markers on the left side and is ?-2-1-1-1-5-Mutation

8th line : shared haplotype on the right side (see 7th line)
For example : 3 1 6 2 1 -1 means that the shared haplotype on the right side is Mutation-3-1-6-2-1-?

9th line and next lines : for each patient: 1) number of the first marker on the left side where allele is not shared, 2) number of the first marker on the right side where allele is not shared, 3) observed allele at this marker on the left side, 4) observed allele at this marker on the right side.

EXAMPLE OF INPUT FILE

RESULTS
Output results are printed on one line:
n is the estimated number of generations
nend is the total number of iterations performed
ninf is the lower bound of the 95% CI
nsup is the upper bound of the 95% CI
likelihood is the corresponding likelihood

For example on the file dataAAA.in: the output will be
n = 47, nend = 128, ninf = 28, nsup = 80, likelihood = -26.412115
meaning that the estimated number of generations is 47 with a 95% CI of [28, 80]
